### Goals

This application initially is planned as a playground for practicing Clean Architecture and DDD mostly.

### About domain

Few years ago during searching for a new episode of series I figured out that it's quite bothering to remember what episode was the last watched. Moreover - tracking for a new seasons is not a trivial task, especially if you are watching your favourite series on different platforms and portals.

This application should help with handling such tasks. Bother about persisting current watching state, updating information in the different sources, posting new into the social media, monitoring for a new seasons or related movies? MovieTracker (a.k.a УчЁтКино) to the rescue!
